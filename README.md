# riot-cart-firebase
This webpage was inspired by Riot Games shopping cart. Products can be added and removed with their corresponding quantity and subtotal change. My goal in this project is to practice using jQuery.  

Live Website: https://riot-shopping-cart.web.app/  
2-min Video Demo:  

# Build with 
Frontend: jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3  
Hosted on Firebase  

# App Features
Select single/multiple/all product(s)  

Add product with quantity, subtotal and total cost change  

Remove single, selected and all product(s)  

# Challenges
This is my first time using jQuery. jQuery simplifies many JS DOM actions, but learning syntax and concepts needed for this project took me three days.  

# Future Implementation
Better CSS styling is expected.   
This webpage can be also incorporated into my previous project:  https://github.com/alohajt/mimic-TFT-Vue-Frontend .
